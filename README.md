# Kotlin Tic-Tac-Toe


This is a simple console-based implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game written in Kotlin as part of hyperskill project practice.

## How to Play

1. Run the program in a Kotlin environment.
2. The game initializes with an empty 3x3 grid.
3. Players take turns entering coordinates (row and column) to make a move.
4. The grid is updated after each valid move.
5. The game ends when a player wins or when there is a draw.
6. The program provides feedback for invalid moves.

## Code Structure

- The `printGrid` function is used to display the current state of the Tic-Tac-Toe grid.
- The `checkWinner` function determines if a player has won based on the current grid.
- The `isGridFull` function checks if the grid is completely filled, indicating a draw.
- The main game loop handles player moves, validates input, and checks for a winner or draw.

## How to Run

Compile and run the Kotlin code using your preferred Kotlin environment or command line.
